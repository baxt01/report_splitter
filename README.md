# report_splitter

This is easier to understand from reading the codes than my explanation i have found,
i start with the file "bg_points.php" which is a simple form that submits to "points_processing1.php" it has some basic HTML inside of it with a form,
most of the code inside the bg_points.php file is to build up my site navigation area the main part you need to see is the form itself which is as simple as a text area named `points` and a submit button named submit,
the real intresting stuff is inside the "points_processing1.php" 
below is a copy of the report that my processing page expects to reeive once you get to the end of reading let me know and i will explane any of this your unsure about have fun gaining a headache :D
                                                                                         cheers mick... AKA baxt01

oh yes once all the processing is over i need to be able to allow players to view the points from a pageview with a default of this months points and an option of reading backward month by month or a running total of points from joining time
